# Overview
## Description
### Idea
Overall, I wanted to take a look at the relationship between the type of labor being performed in rural areas versus their overall Education levels. I felt this could lead to some interesting conclusions about how the labor fource of rural areas organize themselve from this perspective.

### Questions
- Do those with better educations work in different sectors of the workforce than those without?
- What is the largest sector of the workforce in these rural areas?

### Origonal Hypothesis
I hypothesise, therefore:
- That those with better educations are more likely to work in fields such as Technology and business than other areas.
  - I assumed this because this is how it is in most urbanized areas of the U.S.
- That the largest sector of the workforce are associates in both the retail and Hospitatliy.
  - I assumed this because the county least likely to loose population in the previous study where those who were recreation catagorized counties, with those engaged in mining and manfacturing only had small probabilty of loss. 
  - All these have higher population densities than Agricultural economies, and especially since the most hospitallity-dependent catogory, Recreation, has almost no population loss overall, I assumed assoicates would be the largest portions of these economies.

## Source
The Main data source was:
[Atlas of Rural and Small-Town America](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/atlas-of-rural-and-small-town-america)
The following Pages where used:
- [Jobs](IO/Jobs.csv)
- [People](IO/People.csv)

## Experimental Catagories
### Explanation of Catagories
The job catagories are the percantages of the population who work in each secot of the economy, while the education catagories indicate what percentageof   the population holds each kind of educational prospects in rural society.
### Job Catagories
- Civil_Servants - All the bureaucrats, police officers, teachers, and other workers of the State.
- Farmers - Those who work the land in order to produce food, raise livestock, and produce and refine cash crops.
- Teamsters - Warehouse Workers, Truck Drivers, and the like
- Hospitatility_Associates - Low-Wage workers in hotels, restraunts, bars, bowling alleys, theme parks, arcades, etc.
- Craftsmen - Practically just Factory Workers and associated profesions, such as Factory engineers and machinists.
- Builders - Those who build structures, and vocational workers whos assist in the construction process, such as plumbers and electricians.
- Retail_Associates - Low-Wage workers who sell goods to the commity as a whole.
- Businesmen - Workers in Real estate, banking, and insurance.
- Miners - Practically just mine workers and associated profesions, such as mining engineers.
- Technologists - Information Technicians, programers, and Data anaylists.

### Education Catagories
- Post_Secondary_Degree
  - Associates_Degree - Those who posses an associate degree, but not a bachelors
  - College_Graduate - Those who hold at least a bachelors, or anything beyond that.
- No_Post_Secondary_Degree
  - Some_College
  - High_School_Degree
  - Some_High_School
    
# Results
## Numerical Outcomes
- Between those who held a post-secondary degree, and those who did not, there was an over 99% correlation between the populations engaged in each form of business.
- Retail Associates and Hospitality Associates held over 55% of jobs in rural areas, a significant majority over all other groups looked at by the USDA.

## Conclusion
As for the results, there was an over 99% correlation between jobs catories being worked between the college-education and not college educated, showing that Rural societies have little care for college education for who gets put into what positions in such societies. However, my hypothesis that a large portion of the workforce would be Retail and Hospitality assoicates held up, but I was indeed suprised that just these two kinds of labor held a majority of all positions in rural societies

## Further Research
I beleive the next intresting effort is to look over the dataset, and see if it is possible to predict wheather a rural county will loose population due to not only what portions are employed in each industry, but also the portion that are outright unemployed. Then examine the preductive system in able to
